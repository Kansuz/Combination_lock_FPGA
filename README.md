# Combination lock
Project made on Basys3 FPGA from Xilinx within a Technology of Computer Systems laboratory exercise.
## How does it work?
User choses a password and submits it with a button. Then, whoever wants to unlock the lock, has to enter the right password using the second button. There are 3 attemps. Submitting new password (with first button) changes it. The display shows how many attempts have left.
