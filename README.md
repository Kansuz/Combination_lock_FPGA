# Combination lock
Made on Basys3 FPGA from Xilinx.
## How does it work?
User choses a password and submits it with a button. Then, whoever wants to unlock the lock, has to enter the right password using the second button. There are 3 attemps. Submitting new password (with first button) changes it.
